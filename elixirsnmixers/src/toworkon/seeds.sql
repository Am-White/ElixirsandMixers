1 egg white
Garnish: Angostura bitters',

'When you get right down to it, the Bourbon Old Fashioned is little more than a slug of whiskey, seasoned and sweetened.',
'1/2 teaspoon sugar
3 dashes Angostura bitters
1 teaspoon water
2 ounces bourbon
Garnish: orange peel',
'Add the sugar and bitters to a rocks glass, then add the water, and stir until the sugar is nearly dissolved.

Fill the glass with large ice cubes, add the bourbon, and gently stir to combine.

Express the oil of an orange peel over the glass, then drop in.',
'Once you’ve mastered the Bourbon Old Fashioned, you can also try making the cocktail with rye whiskey, which results in a slightly spicier drink. 
Or you can use rum, brandy or any number of spirits—after all, the Old Fashioned is more of a template than an exact science. ');
