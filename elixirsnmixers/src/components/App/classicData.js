        barNotes: 'Maraschino is also used to sweeten the drink made from the marasca cherry a recipe from the 1821 which also has a touch of nuttiness            from being aged in wooden vats. Always use fresh lemon juice. Juicing the fruit right before making the drink will result in the best possible drink. Fortifying all            those ingredients with a juniper flavored distillate gin, which normally has noted of citrus peel along with the prominent gin flavor.',

        barNotes: 'You don’t have to be a rock star to enjoy this tequila cocktail.  It’s sweet, refreshing and delicious, so mix one whenever the mood strikes.  But putting on a Rolling Stones or Eagles record will really complete that ’70s vibe.',

        description: 'Chile and Peru bicker fiercely over the Pisco Sour’s origin (and that of pisco, too), but by most accounts,  the drink’s genesis is tied to a United States citizen. ',

        directions: 'Add pisco, lime juice, simple syrup and egg white into a shaker and dry-shake (without ice) vigorously.  Add ice and shake again until well-chilled.

        directions: 'Add the sugar and bitters to a rocks glass, then add the water, and stir until the sugar is nearly dissolved.  Fill the glass with large ice cubes, add the bourbon, and gently stir to combine.  Express the oil of an orange peel over the glass, then drop in.',
        barNotes: 'Once you’ve mastered the Bourbon Old Fashioned, you can also try making the cocktail with rye whiskey, which results in a slightly spicier drink.  Or you can use rum, brandy or any number of spirits—after all, the Old Fashioned is more of a template than an exact science. ',
